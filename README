This repository contains all the necessary code to replicate my
experiments from my winning submission to the ALTA2012 shared task [1].

It uses the hydrat[2] framework to manage the experiments and 
display/explore the results. The .hydratrc must be modified to
include a key "alta2012-ebm" under the "[corpora]" section, which
should contain the path to the training/test data.

To reproduce the experiments, first run `features.py` to generate all
the feature sets used, then run `ebmcat_stacking.py` to run the actual
experiments. Running the experiments will require libsvm to be installed,
and the appropriate paths configured in the .hydratrc. `corpora.py` contains
the actual implementation of the feature sets used.
